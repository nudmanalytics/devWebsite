								<h3>Role Description</h3>
								<p>The NUDM Emcees are the public faces of Northwestern University Dance Marathon both during the event itself and throughout the year. At Dance Marathon, the Emcees are responsible for maintaining a positive and entertaining atmosphere for the audience, both in the tent and for those watching at home. Most importantly, the Emcees must be prepared to motivate dancers in an encouraging, amusing, and engaging manner, handle unexpected situations with composure, and become the biggest advocates for both the primary beneficiary, Chicago Youth Programs, and the secondary beneficiary, the Evanston Community Foundation, for all 30 hours. To achieve this, the Emcees must present poise, an ability to roll with the punches, and an ability to take direction well.</p>

								<p>Throughout the year, the NUDM Emcees are expected to be the ambassadors of NUDM. As such, they should be prepared to attend all official NUDM events, including but not limited to trivia nights, BUILD events, service days, and the like. Once selected, the Emcees become a part of the Productions Committee; as such, they are expected to work with committee members at Productions committee meetings, which occur at 12:30 pm on Sundays. They are critical members of the Productions team responsible for producing videos shown during and before Dance Marathon. The Emcees also collaborate with other NUDM committees for various events and initiatives.</p>

								<p>The NUDM Emcees must bring the energy, personality, passion, dedication, and integrity necessary to become role models for the entire NUDM community. Moreover, they must be able to educate people about both Northwestern University Dance Marathon and its mission as well as our primary and secondary beneficiaries. As such, the emcees should be knowledgeable about Chicago Youth Programs and the Evanston Community Foundation and be prepared to communicate the missions of both organizations effectively.</p>

								<p>The NUDM Emcees play a vital role in connecting the NUDM community, the Northwestern community, and our beneficiaries both during the event itself and the months leading up to the 30 hours. They should be prepared to take on the commitment necessary to execute their role to the highest degree possible.<br><br><b>See you soon, and break a leg! </b></p>
